## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS framework

### What I learned

This challenge was a great refresher for API's! Super simple but still a good way to test my knowledge by not using to many online resources! I learned that Tailwind is STILL a mobile first CSS framework and that I need to be writing it out as such to avoid redoing things at the end. 


### Continued development

As I continue down the path of Vite/React and Tailwind, I need to ensure that I am revisiting the simple fundamentals of Javascript and CSS. It can be very easy to fall down the rabbit hole and not remember the basics of the basics!
